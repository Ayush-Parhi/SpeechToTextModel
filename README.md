<h3>We might be on the verge of having too many screens around us. It seems like every day, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction is voice interfaces.

TensorFlow has released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people. Here I build a speech recognition system that understands simple spoken commands.

You can download the dataset from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge">here</a>.</h3>
